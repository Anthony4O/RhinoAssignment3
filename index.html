										<p style="color:#000080">Anthony Forti - S3841083</p>
										<p style="color:black">I’ve grown up around IT and technology for as long as I can remember, with my first gaming experience to memory being; playing games such as Club Penguin, Roblox, Minecraft and an F1 racing game. I grew to love technology, often wanting to take apart my dad’s old computers he didn’t use anymore to see how they worked, however breaking them in the process haha. Moving on around 5 years, I had gained the basic skills to troubleshoot family members and friends' devices, through the help of YouTube channels such as LinusTechTips (formerly NCIX), and JayzTwoCents. Graduating high school, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do; I didn’t get accepted into the course I wanted, the Bachelor of IT, but instead received an offer for the Associate Degree of IT instead. This helped me land a job at Centorrino Technologies, where one of the prerequisites was to have or be studying a degree in IT. This job primarily ignited the spark of interest in IT as I was exposed to almost every facet of the IT sector. Centorrino Technologies is a major managed services provider in Melbourne, and had jobs all the way from sales and inventory management, to working on the frontline in schools, providing IT support. The latter part of that made an impact with me, as I saw desktop support officers arriving and leaving everyday to go fix IT issues at schools and businesses and this led me to envisioning myself doing this job in the future. I’d love to move into System Administration / Engineering, or starting off as a Desktop Support Officer, anything tech support / fixing really interests me. I’ve also worked at Beyond The Box, an authorised Apple repairer. I was employed as the check in staff, which required basic troubleshooting, diagnostics, testing, and setting expectations for clients. </p>
										<p style="color:#000080">John Alexandrou - S3972141</p>
										<p style="color:black">I too am Australian born with Greek heritage. I started studying IT this year after transferring from Law which I transferred to from science. I am of Greek descent with all my grandparents being born in Greece; however, both my parents as well as my siblings and I were born here. I graduated Year 12 in 2019 and since then have been attempting to find a degree that suits me. Much to my extended family’s disappointment I only speak English. In my free time I enjoy skateboarding and playing games. My favourite video game of all time is Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory for reasons I should not have to explain. My interest in IT began from a very young age, I remember an old IBM PC that my dad had set up for my sisters and I that I would spend hours on playing 3d pinball and other small games. From then on, I have developed a love for computers, particularly developing interest in networks, security and the internet from films and shows such as The Matrix, Mr. Robot, and particular YouTube changing focusing on the dark web and other internet mysteries. </p>
										<p style="color:#000080">Emily Ng - S3842921</p>
										<p style="color:black">I am a first-year full time student studying a bachelor's degree in information and technology. I grew up in a loving Asian family and was taught to speak Mandarin from an early age. However, as I have grown older, my ability to communicate has weakened. My parents have been my biggest supporter throughout my education and the decisions I've made to reach this point. I was extremely fortunate that my parents did not conform to the typical Asian stereotypes of grades and success being the highest priority, as my family valued the learning and experiences a lot more. What prompted my initial interest in IT was my older brother, and all the games he used to play on the X-box, PSP, and Gameboy, I loved watching the animations and the gameplay of his games; GTA, FIFA and Halo. I was also an ICT leader in primary school, and my role consisted of altering and enhancing our school's main website, as well as assisting teachers with any fundamental IT issues. It was a fun role, and it fuelled my interest even further. Technology has always astounded me with how it has revolutionised and improved our daily jobs. </p>
										<p style="color:#000080">John Gionis - S3901535</p>
										<p style="color:black">I’m Australian born with also a Greek ethnicity. I am in my second year of studying my Batchelor of Mechanical Engineering at RMIT. I have a massive interest in mechanical systems, particularly revolving around land transportation (cars, motorbikes, trains, trams). I especially love cars and very commonly spend my free time working on mine. My interest in IT mainly involves hardware and how it operates. This hardware is of particular interest when it controls and operates physical/mechanical systems, so computer and machine can work together (such as a car ECU). This developed when I started pulling apart everything to see how it worked, particularly stuff like tape players, digital clocks, and old desktop computers. As I got older, I developed an interest in older handheld technology, particularly old iPods after becoming interested in a YouTube channel called Dankpods. I have chosen to study Mechanical Engineering at RMIT because the course was highly recommended to me for the way the course is executed, alongside the industry connections RMIT has. I also chose RMIT because a lot of my friends from school chose RMIT, meaning we could keep in contact alongside developing other friendships. </p>
										<p style="color:#000080">Jaideep Singh - S3948197</p>
										<p style="color:black">My nationality is Australian, but ethnically I am from India, and I speak both Punjabi and English. I graduated high school last year and am currently completing a Bachelor of Information Technology. An interesting fact about me is that both my grandparents were born in Pakistan, and that some of my great grandfathers migrated from Iran and Afghanistan. Other facts about me are that I lift weights, am a fan of the UFC (GSP being my goat), and my favourite pastime is going out and drinking. My interest in IT started from an early age, when my dad came home in 2010 with a dusty old computer that his boss was throwing away. I would use that computer 24/7 in awe of this new thing (for me at least), known as the internet. I think coming from a country and environment who at the time did not have a lot of technology, I became instantly interested in all the new phones, computers, and other technology in Australia. I started watching youtubers, such as MKBHD, bit wit, Jayztwocents, Austin Evans and LinusTechTips, who all gave me insight to new software and hardware, and even inspired me to build my own computer after saving up. Additionally, I have always been fascinated by space and have dreamt of being an astronaut since I could talk, however math really is not my strong suit, so after research I discovered the importance of programmers, and other IT related experts required to be in the space industry, and thus pursued IT at RMIT. </p>
										<p style="color:#000080">Alexandar Mirsopoulos - S3838798</p>
										<p style="color:black">I'm an Australian born Greek who is studying the Bachelor of Information Technology course at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. I am always looking forward to studying and expanding my knowledge, being always ready to learn more. I took an interest in Information Technology at a young age, when my dad had first introduced me to a computer and the concept of Videogames. What had caught my attention more than the actual Videogames themselves, was the thought of how they were created. For this reason, I'm a really big fan of all things technical, but mostly of online multiplayer Videogames. A Videogame I grew up on and fell in-love with over the years was League of Legends, and it has always been a dream of mine to play for a professional team and be competing at the highest of leagues against other professionals. I chose to study at RMIT due to its accessibility and how open the campus is. During my studies at RMIT, I expect to learn how to properly engage myself and have enough preparation to branch out and search for a job which I will love. </p>

								<h2>Group Processes</h2>
								<p>Between our team members, it is agreed upon that our group worked reasonably well in the completion of assignment 2. Our group got the assignment done and did not have major conflicts. Our members’ willingness to assist each other was a particular strength. If someone was struggling with their assigned task, other group members would assist to get the persons’ task completed.</p>
								<p>I feel like our group may need to communicate and discuss verbally on a more frequent basis. We are implementing more frequent group meetings (at least once per week) between group members either on a call or in person. This will benefit every group member as every group member can be properly informed on the group decisions, alongside instructions set out to them. This also will show that all the group members are dedicated and willing to contribute to the group, as there were various teammates that missed multiple meetings.</p>
								<h2>Career Plans<br/></h2>
								<table class="demo">
									<caption>These ideal jobs have not changed since Assignment 2. The following table lists these jobs below:</caption>
									<thead>
									<tr>
										<th>Alexander</th>
										<th>Jaideep</th>
										<th>John G</th>
										<th>John A</th>
										<th>Anthony</th>
										<th>Emily</th>
									</tr>
									</thead>
									<tbody>
									<tr>
										<td>&nbsp;Professional LOL Player</td>
										<td>&nbsp;React Developer</td>
										<td>&nbsp;Mechanical Engineer</td>
										<td>&nbsp;Security Engineer</td>
										<td>&nbsp;Systems Engineer</td>
										<td>&nbsp;UX Designer</td>

								<p>The employment pathways of a majority of the group members have a focus on completion of tertiary study, alongside gaining experience within their specified field before they can start their ideal employment. Other Similarities Within the Group are listed below:</p>
								
								<ul>
									<li>Jaideep, John G, John A, and Anthony all idealise jobs that focus on the development and/or maintenance of a system.</li>
									<li>Emily, Jaideep and John A all require some sort of coding knowledge or software development knowledge</li>
									<li>Anthony and John G’s ideal jobs also entail hands-on hardware implementation and management within their tasks.</li>
									<li>All team members apart from John G have IT-based ideal jobs, thus requiring some sort of specialised computer skill.</li>
									<li>All team members require communication and collaboration skills for their ideal job.</li>
									<li>All team members are looking to solve some sort of problem, thus requiring problem solving skills</li>
									</ul>
							
							<p>Whilst there are similarities within the group, each team members’ specific ideal employment opportunity requires a vastly different specific skillset for consideration of employment:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>All team members apart from Alexander would directly work to solve a problem that a client has approached them with. Alexander utilises his problem-solving skills in the League of Legends videogame. However, Alex’s decisions would affect himself and his team rather than a paying client. This does have an advantage as this creates freedom of choice. This would still require good communication and collaboration skills.</li>
							<li>Jaideep’s role is focused on databases and management of a team of developers. This means that he would be a team leader. This would mean that Jaideep would be responsible for leading a team of developers to meet the clients’ needs. Jaideep would require good team leader skills. Jaideep’s role would also involve coding for development. This means that Jaideep would need to possess sufficient knowledge of coding languages, such as Git.</li>
							<li>Emily’s role is to design, develop, and implement the front-end of systems for clients. Emily must be able to work collaboratively within a team of front-end developers, where they would be able to meet the criteria set by the clients. Emily’s ideal job is also quite Software based, thus requiring extensive knowledge of computer languages, such as JavaScript.</li>
							<li>John G’s role is focused engineering and recommending improved elements within a virus control lab. This requires engineering knowledge, alongside communication and collaboration to the lab staff about improvements.</li>
							<li>Anthony’s ideal Job is an ICT Systems Engineer. This consists of implementing, management and maintenance of a server infrastructure. Anthony would require a Thorough understanding of servers and server equipment, alongside excellent collaboration skill within his team to achieve completion of the required tasks in this job.</li>
							<li>John A.’s Ideal job is a cyber security engineer. This consists of coding and setting up security measures to prevent malicious activity by an unwanted individual. John would need to have extensive knowledge regarding cybersecurity, alongside good cooperation skills to meet the criteria of the client.</li>
