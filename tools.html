								<p style="color:#000080">Overview</p>
								<p>A computer device is needed for both the original programming of the application and the creation of the UX design effects, a shared Github repository for the application's framework. We would require a mobile device (IOS or Android) in order to test this application and its framework. In order to integrate a map when the user is choosing a restaurant, the application would additionally need a Map API key.</p>
								<p>Following the initial trial of the application, if we are pleased with the results, we would conduct a more thorough test with users. To do this, we would use stratified sampling to compile a population of users, allowing us to test the application with a variety of users who may experience different challenges, such as language barriers or visual problems. Since the software is adaptable and suitable for a wide range of ages, we would strive to gather research on the problems that these users might encounter with it. After that, by analysing and enabling additional trustworthy tests, we would continue to build the programme while taking into account the feedback of these people. After that, we would create a series of scenarios with profiles and conduct user testing to determine how simple it is to carry out important fundamental actions that users are likely to perform frequently. Regarding the user population, we would consider implementing online user testing. To do this, we would only submit our application to a website along with a set of instructions for accessing the app. The app would then be made available to thousands of users throughout the world via the platform. These users document their interactions with the software, including live commentary and comment recording. However, we would conduct surveys and use websites like surveymonkey.com and oneopinion.com in order to gather a stratified sample of consumers.We would need somewhere between 50 and 100 users to get a fair sense of how well the website fits the requirements.</p>
