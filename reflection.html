								<p style="color:#000080">Group Reflection</p>
								<p style="color:black">Overall, our group feels like we performed quite well throughout the semester. This is because we felt like a majority of our group members communicated and collaborated very well, which is the key to good teamwork. </p>
								<p style="color:black">Our team established that group communication, collaboration, and teamwork was essential to developing good professional relationships within members. If every individual in the team showed excellent communication, collaboration, and teamwork towards the group, this would mean that every teammate can be trusted to ‘pull their own weight’ and submit adequate work, as well as gaining respect for showing dedication towards group work.</p>
								<p style="color:black">We also established efficient teamwork must not include bickering, disputes, and ‘dud’ team members in the team dynamic. Fortunately, throughout the semester, our team members did not have any major disputes and did not bicker with each other, which thoroughly contributed to the respect that each team member felt for each other.</p>
								<p style="color:black">For our team to utilise excellent communication, collaboration, and teamwork within each other, the group decided to try and organise in person group meetings or online Microsoft Teams group calls at least once per week, with more if required. Collectively, our group specified the importance of these meetings, particularly the initial meetings where assessments would be broken down and analysed so that all the group members could understand what the assignment is about and what to do. From here, tasks within each assignment would be assigned to each group member. Follow up meetings were also important, as this would be the ‘check in time’ where everyone would ask about each other’s tasks and how they were going with completing them. Team members could also ask for help with tasks or offer feedback and alterations to individuals to improve their work.</p>
								<p style="color:black">Most team members would make constant efforts to attend these organised meetings. These team members demonstrated active dedication towards the team achieving end goals. These team members further portray that they can be trusted because of their team dedication.</p>
								<p style="color:black">Attendance, call history and Teams message feed can prove this by looking at the call log of teams {Appendix}.</p>
								<p style="color:black">As stated before, if no bickering, disputes, and ‘dud’ team members occurred, this would maximise our team dynamic and thus help with the completion of tasks throughout the semester. Unfortunately, a few teammates were less outgoing than others. These individuals possessed the following detrimental traits:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Lack of effort to attend meetings, with one individual not attending a single meeting the entire semester. </li>
									<li>Little to no communication in general with other group members about what is going on.</li>
									<li>Submission of incomplete, sub-par, or even no work at all towards main tasks, thus increasing workload between contributing individuals and/or reducing credibility of our group idea; inadequate work leading to a lower mark and less respect from the tutor. </li>
								</ul>
								<p style="color:black">It seemed that comments were also made regarding the reasoning that these team members could not show adequate dedication and trust. {reference message saying they were sick and could not contribute to assignment 2: chat feed} {Reference Alex’s email}. The rest of the groups are unable to determine the validity of this statements, and therefore cannot criticize these comments. However from our groups’ understanding, these teammates made no attempt to submit special consideration or ask the tutor for an extension. Because from the other team members point of view, the lack of communication about what was going on with their life to the rest of us, alongside the submission of poor quality or no work, makes these individuals appear lazy and uninterested in the assignments.</p>
								<p style="color:black">The lack of communication, collaboration, and teamwork shown by these individuals negatively affects the team dynamic. The following wads present throughout the semester:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Irritation was shown towards these individuals by the rest of the adequately contributing team members due to the lack of communication or effort shown towards the assignments. The lack of contribution results in the contributing group members being required to do more work. The lack of communication from these team members provides further frustration because if they do then ask what was said in the meeting, we must explain everything again over text {Appendix: Chat feed}.</li>
									<li>This was expressed to be equally as frustrating when these individuals could occasionally submit subpar work, causing the group to receive a negatively tainted assignment mark. This comes across as just a lack of care and selfishness as they do not seem to mind about the team result, it just appears that they would rather not put in the effort because they don’t want to.</li>
								</ul>
								<p style="color:black">The resultant of these individuals’ apparent demonstration with a lack of care, effort and dedication towards the group mass irritation and a major lack of respect and trust in these group members as they just can’t be trusted to contribute anything of adequate effort towards the assignment. This overall had a major effect on the efficiency that our team could work as a whole. This was disappointing.</p>
