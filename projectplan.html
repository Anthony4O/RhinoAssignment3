									<h1>Project Plan</h1>

								<p>
								<p style="color:#000080">Overview</p>
								<p style="color:black">The purpose of the DineIn restaurant app is to provide a convenient and efficient way for restaurant customers that are looking to dine in to find available seating in the restaurants of their choosing, as well as further customisation to the choice. The app will use Augmented Reality to provide the user with a layout of the restaurant, where they can then choose from available tables and the subsequent size and layout of the table if available. All the available options will be chosen by the restaurant, they will be able to customise what users can and cannot interact with.</p>
								<p style="color:#000080">Motivation</p>
								<p style="color:black">Delivery and takeaway options have become very readily available in recent years, with applications such as Uber, Menulog and Deliveroo all being extremely popular for consumer convenience. However, dine in options are still quite lacklustre, with even popular options on Uber being extremely barebones. Now in 2022, after two years of lockdowns and COVID-19, more people than ever are wanting to be out of the house and enjoying restaurants in person with their loved ones. A convenient app such as this will provide an option for easy dine in bookings, allowing the simplicity found in home delivery apps that is not popularly available in the current application market.</p>
								<p style="color:#000080">Landscape</p>
								<p style="color:black">While there are similar apps available on the market as of now, their functionality does not provide the same convenience and options available on this app. While the apps provide timeslots for specific numbers at restaurants, they do not provide the options, customisation and augmented reality experience provided by DineIn.</p>
								<p style="color:#000080">Aim</p>
								<p style="color:black">To allow customers to easily find and book reservations at nearby restaurants, with the aim of integrating the app features to a bigger company/application such as uber eats. Our first goal is that users should be presented with a screen upon initialization of the app which prompts them to create an account or to log in, this is an important goal, as the booking system uses account details to let restaurants know who has booked at what time. Secondly, our next goal is to allow users to book reservations quickly and simply. Booking reservations is a given, as it is the primary purpose of the app. However, making it simple is a major goal for us. The app is directed at people who want to take the hassle out of making dining decisions, therefore booking should be straightforward, easy to locate, and easy to understand once a booking has been confirmed. Lastly, our third goal is to create a map / direction system, to help users locate nearby restaurants, as well as give them directions. One of our main mindsets with the app is to create an all-inclusive ‘package’ of sorts, allowing users to reserve at a restaurant without knowing the whereabouts felt out of place. Therefore, rather than leaving users in the dark and having them google for directions, we felt a map with directions would be helpful. </p>
								<p style="color:#000080">What are the most important parts of the project? Which parts should have priority over others? If we only have enough time or resources for one of our goals, which one should it be?</p>
								<p style="color:black">The most important parts of the project are booking reservations for customers and creating an account for them to add information. While a map would be beneficial, successfully making reservations and user accounts needs to have higher priority, as without these features the restaurant will have no knowledge of any reservations and the app would have no purpose. And lastly, if we were only able to achieve one goal, it would be booking reservations with available tables.</p>
								
								
								<p style="color:#000080">Plans and Progress</p>
								<p style="color:red">The ‘story’ of the project, how it began, progressed, what stages of the plan you are up to:</p>
								<p style="color:black">Our project began on a group call, where Anthony mentioned the idea of a restaurant booking system. However, the initial plan was different to what we would end up going with, the original idea was based on both hardware and software features, it involved a table system with LEDs, which would change colours based on whether the table was vacant, booked, or free. The system involved an app/website design that would allow customers to book tables, cancel bookings, and for restaurants to change the colour of the lights based on what customers book. Nevertheless, this design presented a few issues that were difficult to address, the system would have to be adopted by restaurants which, getting the hardware, the LEDs, the wiring, and having it all sync up to a computer is difficult and time-consuming work; and beyond our group's current capabilities. Upon further meetings and discussions, it was decided that the hardware component (the LED system) would have to be ditched for a simpler approach. Our new plan revolved around an app with a reservation system, allowing customers to book tables at nearby restaurants, while viewing the restaurants' information and details. Yet, we felt this idea was far too ‘common’ and frankly a boring idea for an app. During the third assignment, we decided to include a virtual walkthrough feature, which would give the user a 3d walkthrough of the restaurant, allowing them to decide on tables based on the layout of the location. The inspiration behind it was to make the app more interesting and intuitive rather than a basic copy of other similar table booking services. While attempting to implement this feature, we used the ‘vectary 3d’ plugin which proved to be difficult to operate, a lot of our attempts seemed to not work, or only worked on single devices for brief periods of time. After further consideration and due to time constraints, we decided that a simple map feature to direct users to nearby locations was the best way to go as we hit a dead end in the process of creating an AR environment. Currently, we are in the designing stages of the plan, while there is no working prototype, we do have interactive designs on the username/password menu, the account settings menu, the booking confirmation page, and the search/map page. Most of the buttons are clickable and functioning, users are able to switch between pages and confirm bookings, however certain features such as a working search bar with results could only be programmed with the help of a database and a proper code editor.</p>
								<p style="color:red">What the project will do and how:</p>
								<p style="color:black">There are a few main features of the project that we focused on, firstly was account creation. In order to avoid having the username fill out tedious forms we plan to incorporate using google/Facebook accounts to sign in and store information, this can be done through an API, the accounts are used to store user information (such as name, card details, bookings), information which can be used for each booking made by the user so that they don’t have to constantly fill in details during each reservation.  We incorporated this into the main page of the app, which opens upon installation and launch, so that the user must create an account in order to use the features. The next feature is obviously, reservations. Reservations can be made through the ‘search’ page on the app, which can be found after switching to the tab at the bottom of the screen, the page greets the user with a text input search bar allowing them to type in the name of a restaurant, a menu item, menu style, and a drop-down menu with filters to allow for further specification. The search bar is also accompanied by a map, which corresponds to the nearby area of the user, after each search the map also updates with the location of the menu. This will be done using the google maps api once the project is being programmed, however for the design stage we used the ‘mapsicle’ plugin to create a scrollable map, as for the reservations in order to store information, we are planning to build a database in the future so that information can be stored and accessed when needed. Another key part are the restaurants that will be implemented into the app, in order to import these locations we will look at open table’s restaurant list/data and add accordingly.</p>
								<p style="color:red">How far you have come with developing features/outcomes from project:</p>
								<p style="color:red">Sign-in page:</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/sign in.jpg" alt="Sign In Page" /></div>
								<p style="color:black">Our application colour theme changed from its original concept to a navy blue and pale yellow theme, the above screen showcases what to expect when first downloading the app, or logging out, we have not been able to implement the saving and creation of usernames and passwords yet, however, we plan to incorporate databases in order to save the information. Additionally, we plan to add google and Facebook account options using the corresponding API to allow users to use their pre-existing information and emails. </p>
								<p style="color:red">Restaurant Page:</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/restaurant.jpg" alt="Restaurant Page" /></div>
								<p style="color:black">The above page shows an early design of what a restaurant page could look like, the times below show the available table bookings, the ‘morning’, ‘midday’, and ‘night’ buttons will change the bookings accordingly however this function is currently only a design and not yet working. In the future we also hope to add a ‘more’ option, which will give additional options about the restaurant. Such as the menu, location (links to the in app map), dress code, parking, and other critical information. </p>
								<p style="color:red">Confirmation Alert:</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/booking.jpg" alt="Booking Confirmation Page" /></div>
								<p style="color:black">The above pop up menu, illustrates the alert the user receives once a booking has been confirmed, currently the design allows for people to select a time and confirm, prompting the message. In the future we wish to include a link system, which sends a link to the users corresponding email address, as well as a bookings page in the user account menu, which allows users to show the restaurant their booking once they have arrived in person. </p>
								<p style="color:red">Account/Settings menu:</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/account.jpg" alt="Account Page" /></div>
								<p style="color:black">The above image displays the apps setting/edit page. Each Subheading is a link to a page which allows users to edit or change the corresponding information, currently while the page is accessible, the links are not working and information is not able to be stored or updated. We also wish to add a ‘my bookings’ link, which shows past and current table bookings made by the user. </p>
								<p style="color:red">Search and Map page:</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/map.jpg" alt="Map Page" /></div>
								<p style="color:black">The search and map currently allow the user to scroll through the map, and sift through nearby restuarants, the hamburger icon is also clickable and allows to navigate to other pages. While the information is not accurate (doesn’t actually gather real nearby restaurants), the design is a nice blueprint of our final product. In the future, we hope to incorporate a filter option underneath the search bar, a drop menu that allows the user to customize preferred cuisine/menu, environment(outdoor/indoor/rooftop), number of guests, and date/time of booking. The map will be implemented using google maps api and use the search keywords as well as the users location to update over time or after each search. </p>
								
								
								
								
								<p style="color:#000080">Roles</p>
								<p style="color:black">While roles have not specifically been highlighted for each member, Sections of the report have been sectioned off to individuals to take the lead on, but with everyone helping each other whenever it is needed. However, based on specific interests and personal skills, members have taken lead on aspects of the project. For example, Emily has taken the lead in the design of the logo as well as the layout of the application due to her interest in front end development and user interface design, though everyone is to contribute and take part in the process.</p>
								<p style="color:#000080">Scope and Limits</p>
								<p style="color:black">The creation of our application “Dine-in: Restaurant Booker” is created with the intention to make a reservation at ease. We intend our customers to have the ability to last second have the ability to make plans at any of the selected restaurants within a reasonable timeframe. Although our application may be limited quite heavily by what restaurants allow our application to have access to their bookings, we plan that our ease of use, our ability to be reused, and our ability to book without having to interact with a worker may make things a lot easier for customers, especially if there’s a language barrier if the customer intends to try something new. We intend for our application to be used for reservations, couple-dates, business dinners, team celebration pizza party’s and so much more. The application will include a mapping system showing you where nearby restaurants are with available bookings and keep track of where you have booked before. Though as time is of the essence, our competed dream application for some time might have to stay as a dream, but with some more time and resources our application could make restaurant bookings an ease.</p>
								<p style="color:#000080">Tools and Technologies</p>
								<ul>
									<li>IOS and Android devices, in order to test the application, for bugs/errors/format/scaling.</li>
									<li>Internet Connection.</li>
									<li>Windows 8 or above desktop/laptop/computer, for programming/designing. </li>
									<li>Invision for prototype creation, no licenses or purchase required.</li>
									<li>Figma, for collaboration on design.</li>
									<li>Microsoft teams, for meetings and communications.</li>
								</ul>>
								<p>None of our team members has previous experience using any of the design applications such as  invision or figma, however we are all quite familiar with the usage of computers, teams, and mobile devices.</p>
								<p style="color:#000080">Timeframe</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/table.png" alt="Timeframe Table" /></div>
								<p style="color:#000080">Risks</p>
								<p style="color:black">For our mobile app, ‘Dine-in: Restaurant Booker’, there were many risks associated with the project in the development and testing stages. Most arguably, the biggest risk when developing the app, was that we were running with a concept that all our group members have never previously developed mobile applications and have no experience with the coding languages or application builders. For example, for our prototype of our application, we were using a website called Figma. Figma is a mobile development builder for applications and websites, that provides an interactive experience into what an application will look like in its final stages. The risk we were facing with using this builder is that, only one or two members in our group have previously used this website, therefore the rest of us are very unfamiliar with it. As a result of this, our application may not be up to the standard that we would like, as at the same time as developing the application, we also had to learn the development side of this. Another side risk of this is that as we had to learn the builder at the same time as developing the application, it put a large time constraint on our deadlines, resulting in an uneven balance between learning the builder and creating features of the application.</p>
								<p style="color:black">Furthermore, a very significant and notable risk we had to consider was the short timeframe we had to produce the application. As there was only 13 weeks in the semester, with 4 of those spent being introduced to the course and finding groups, time became a scarcity, rather than a luxury. As a result of this, we had to put in place weekly meetings, stick to these times and use class time as effectively as possible, to distribute tasks and share the heavy workload. Lastly, as a result of bypassing this risk, we were able to successfully put our application prototype forward, finish all our reports within the specified time and have all features implemented and working properly. </p>
								<p style="color:black">Lastly, as a result of the risks mentioned above, there was one risk that overtook all our other risks by a large majority. This risk was not hitting the deadline of the end of Week 13 and having all our features working as intended on our application. We worked hard to assess these risks and tried our best to not make these a reality, ensuring that our application will be working as intended. </p>
