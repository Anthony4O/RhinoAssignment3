									<h1>Project Plan</h1>

								<p style="color:#000080">Overview</p>
								<p style="color:black">The purpose of the DineIn restaurant app is to provide a convenient and efficient way for restaurant customers that are looking to dine in to find available seating in the restaurants of their choosing, as well as further customisation to the choice. The app will use Augmented Reality to provide the user with a layout of the restaurant, where they can then choose from available tables and the subsequent size and layout of the table if available. All the available options will be chosen by the restaurant, they will be able to customise what users can and cannot interact with.</p>
								<p style="color:#000080">Motivation</p>
								<p style="color:black">Delivery and takeaway options have become very readily available in recent years, with applications such as Uber, Menulog and Deliveroo all being extremely popular for consumer convenience. However, dine in options are still quite lacklustre, with even popular options on Uber being extremely barebones. Now in 2022, after two years of lockdowns and COVID-19, more people than ever are wanting to be out of the house and enjoying restaurants in person with their loved ones. A convenient app such as this will provide an option for easy dine in bookings, allowing the simplicity found in home delivery apps that is not popularly available in the current application market.</p>
								<p style="color:#000080">Landscape</p>
								<p style="color:black">While there are similar apps available on the market as of now, their functionality does not provide the same convenience and options available on this app. While the apps provide timeslots for specific numbers at restaurants, they do not provide the options, customisation and augmented reality experience provided by DineIn.</p>
								<p style="color:#000080">Aim</p>
								<p style="color:black">To allow customers to easily find and book reservations at nearby restaurants, with the aim of integrating the app features to a bigger company/application such as uber eats. Our first goal is that users should be presented with a screen upon initialization of the app which prompts them to create an account or to log in, this is an important goal, as the booking system uses account details to let restaurants know who has booked at what time. Secondly, our next goal is to allow users to book reservations quickly and simply. Booking reservations is a given, as it is the primary purpose of the app. However, making it simple is a major goal for us. The app is directed at people who want to take the hassle out of making dining decisions, therefore booking should be straightforward, easy to locate, and easy to understand once a booking has been confirmed. Lastly, our third goal is to create a map / direction system, to help users locate nearby restaurants, as well as give them directions. One of our main mindsets with the app is to create an all-inclusive ‘package’ of sorts, allowing users to reserve at a restaurant without knowing the whereabouts felt out of place. Therefore, rather than leaving users in the dark and having them google for directions, we felt a map with directions would be helpful. </p>
								<p style="color:#000080">What are the most important parts of the project? Which parts should have priority over others? If we only have enough time or resources for one of our goals, which one should it be?</p>
								<p style="color:black">The most important parts of the project are booking reservations for customers and creating an account for them to add information. While a map would be beneficial, successfully making reservations and user accounts needs to have higher priority, as without these features the restaurant will have no knowledge of any reservations and the app would have no purpose. And lastly, if we were only able to achieve one goal, it would be booking reservations with available tables.</p>
								<p style="color:#000080">Plans and Progress</p>
								<p style="color:black">insert text</p>
								<p style="color:#000080">Roles</p>
								<p style="color:black">While roles have not specifically been highlighted for each member, Sections of the report have been sectioned off to individuals to take the lead on, but with everyone helping each other whenever it is needed. However, based on specific interests and personal skills, members have taken lead on aspects of the project. For example, Emily has taken the lead in the design of the logo as well as the layout of the application due to her interest in front end development and user interface design, though everyone is to contribute and take part in the process.</p>
								<p style="color:#000080">Scope and Limits</p>
								<p style="color:black">The creation of our application “Dine-in: Restaurant Booker” is created with the intention to make a reservation at ease. We intend our customers to have the ability to last second have the ability to make plans at any of the selected restaurants within a reasonable timeframe. Although our application may be limited quite heavily by what restaurants allow our application to have access to their bookings, we plan that our ease of use, our ability to be reused, and our ability to book without having to interact with a worker may make things a lot easier for customers, especially if there’s a language barrier if the customer intends to try something new. We intend for our application to be used for reservations, couple-dates, business dinners, team celebration pizza party’s and so much more. The application will include a mapping system showing you where nearby restaurants are with available bookings and keep track of where you have booked before. Though as time is of the essence, our competed dream application for some time might have to stay as a dream, but with some more time and resources our application could make restaurant bookings an ease.</p>
								<p style="color:#000080">Tools and Technologies</p>
								<ul>
									<li>IOS and Android devices, in order to test the application, for bugs/errors/format/scaling.</li>
									<li>Internet Connection.</li>
									<li>Windows 8 or above desktop/laptop/computer, for programming/designing. </li>
									<li>Invision for prototype creation, no licenses or purchase required.</li>
									<li>Figma, for collaboration on design.</li>
									<li>Microsoft teams, for meetings and communications.</li>
								</ul>>
								<p>None of our team members has previous experience using any of the design applications such as  invision or figma, however we are all quite familiar with the usage of computers, teams, and mobile devices.</p>
								<p style="color:#000080">Timeframe</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/table.png" alt="Timeframe Table" /></div>
								<p style="color:#000080">Risks</p>
								<p style="color:black">For our mobile app, ‘Dine-in: Restaurant Booker’, there were many risks associated with the project in the development and testing stages. Most arguably, the biggest risk when developing the app, was that we were running with a concept that all our group members have never previously developed mobile applications and have no experience with the coding languages or application builders. For example, for our prototype of our application, we were using a website called Figma. Figma is a mobile development builder for applications and websites, that provides an interactive experience into what an application will look like in its final stages. The risk we were facing with using this builder is that, only one or two members in our group have previously used this website, therefore the rest of us are very unfamiliar with it. As a result of this, our application may not be up to the standard that we would like, as at the same time as developing the application, we also had to learn the development side of this. Another side risk of this is that as we had to learn the builder at the same time as developing the application, it put a large time constraint on our deadlines, resulting in an uneven balance between learning the builder and creating features of the application.</p>
								<p style="color:black">Furthermore, a very significant and notable risk we had to consider was the short timeframe we had to produce the application. As there was only 13 weeks in the semester, with 4 of those spent being introduced to the course and finding groups, time became a scarcity, rather than a luxury. As a result of this, we had to put in place weekly meetings, stick to these times and use class time as effectively as possible, to distribute tasks and share the heavy workload. Lastly, as a result of bypassing this risk, we were able to successfully put our application prototype forward, finish all our reports within the specified time and have all features implemented and working properly. </p>
								<p style="color:black">Lastly, as a result of the risks mentioned above, there was one risk that overtook all our other risks by a large majority. This risk was not hitting the deadline of the end of Week 13 and having all our features working as intended on our application. We worked hard to assess these risks and tried our best to not make these a reality, ensuring that our application will be working as intended. </p>
